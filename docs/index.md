### The Challenge
Create a single contract that implements both ERC721 (NFTs) and ERC20 (tokens) without compromising security or functionality.

### The Solution
```solidity
contract ArtPlatform is
    ERC721URIStorage,    // Standard NFT functionality
    ERC721Enumerable,    // NFT enumeration
    Ownable,             // Access control
    ReentrancyGuard,     // Reentrancy protection
    Pausable             // Emergency controls
{
    // Manual ERC20 implementation
    mapping(address => uint256) private _tokenBalances;
    // ... additional ERC20 state and functions
}
```

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Full ERC721 standard compliance
